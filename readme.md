## Overview

LeadPages APIs embrace several core ideas that guide how our APIs present
themselves. The aim of this document is to document those ideas, whether it be
through concrete examples or prose. The rest of the overview provides some
detail on what those core ideas are.

### APIs Are User Experiences
We place an emphasis on developer experience, both for others and ourselves.
We are our own API consumers, and we must be efficient and concerted in both
our creation and use of APIs.

### APIs Are Designed
An API presents itself as the best representation of something. It is
structured, thought-out, canonical, and has semantic importance. An API could
be [considered a contract](http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/),
or putting your best foot forward. These are justifications for utilizing a
design process. This document helps in the design process by guiding the process
of deciding "what goes where and why" and moving the "why" out of the core
development process. This helps keep the API design process measured and
repeatable.

### APIs Are Opinionated
This document provides guidelines and examples for LeadPages HTTP APIs,
encouraging consistency, maintainability, and best practices across
applications. Best practices may come with scenarios that pit The Right Wayâ„¢
against the pragmatic way. LeadPages APIs aim to balance the rigor and
structure of a REST API with a positive developer experience. We'll always go
for the best solution when it's practical to do so.

### APIs Are Interfaces

It's in the name. APIs are a developer's user interface to a service. When
tough questions arise about the design of the API, we can defer to experts.
Jakob Nielsen's "Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" have provided
designers with research-based common ground and apply well to developers using
an API.

Reading [the heuristics themselves](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
is the ideal starting point, but they are summarized here.

- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation

## Base URL

The base URL of an API resource reflects a few key considerations. This
example base URL is the primary URL structure.

- `https://api.company.com/service/v1`

For clarification, here is the base URL in the context of a full resource
URL. This is **not** a base URL:

- `https://api.company.com/service/v1/sprockets/a1b2c3`

In some cases, it may make sense to structure the base URL to include the API
name as a subdomain.

- `https://service.company.com/api/v1`

What follows are high-level things to notice in the base URL, and they are
ordered by first appearance.

### SSL/TLS
The protocol (`https`) is specified in the base URL. This is purposeful.
SSL/TLS is a minimum requirement and specifying a base URL beginning with
`http` is invalid. There are [lots](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html)
of [resources](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/548029/how-much-overhead-does-ssl-impose)
and [discussions](http://code.flickr.net/2014/04/30/flickr-api-going-ssl-only-on-june-27th-2014/)
about [why](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-is-making-ssl-fast/)
SSL/TLS only is a good choice and why others choose that path, and addressing
concerns about speed and overhead.

### Domain Scheme
The API in this example is hosted on a subdomain dedicated to a set of APIs.
This distinction is important, because it necessitates the idea of an API
name, discussed below.

- If there are multiple APIs, and they make sense grouped under the company
as an entity, having several named APIs is a logical grouping.
- If the subdomain is a specific product, service, or similar, and there are
very few of them, the alternate example may make more sense. In this case,
the API name is replaced with the `api` fragment to indicate that this is the
sole, self-contained API for this item. This API should be comprehensive and
should not overlap functionality with other APIs located on other subdomains.

### API Names
This API is named `data`. You would call this the "Data API" based on the
fragment in the URL. You could also have API names like `admin` or `tasks`
that you would call the "Administration API" and "Tasks API," respectively.
The goal of having an API name in the path is to provide a sensible grouping
of top-level objects. In an Admin API, you might have top-level objects like
"users" that would not make sense if placed next to "tasks" in a Tasks API.
In the full resource URL example above, the top-level objects are `widgets`.

A few notes about choosing an API name:

- The name should either reflect a service or a branded product, and ideally
the name will reflect a service. Thus, an API name like `aggregator` should be
chosen over some branded equivalent in most cases.
- The name should never reflect an internal or informal name, like a project
or team codename.

There are some heuristics for choosing an API name that reflects a generic
service vs. a product-centric API name. For example, product-centric APIs are
likely to utilize several service APIs as components, and may only function to
house the data model and schema for a resource.

### Versioning
A version (`v1`) is specified in the URL. API versioning helps ease
transitions when there are breaking changes to the interface put forward by
an API, and makes for smoother and more straightforward deprecation plans. If
an API update will break clients and implementations, at a minimum, we want to
know how many will be affected, and a versioned API is the place to
start for finding that information.

Version tags begin with a `v` and end with a a positive integer and have
nothing in between. Requests without a version tag are invalid and must be
rejected.

An API must always provide the latest version as part of the API metadata, for
example, as a response at the root of the API (`/sprockets/v1`).

Versions must be maintained at least one version back. If the `v3` API is
current, the `v2` API must be marked as deprecated but kept available. This
helps solidfy the "contract" between the service and the developer. One of the
reasons having an API version is so important is because the schema of the API
is provided by the API service itself; thus, the API version represents not
just functionality, but actually the version of the data model itself.

The API may include minor or patch version information as part of the
metadata of the API or response.

Based on the idea that the version also reflects the data model, schema
changes have the following impacts on the version:

| Change             | Major Version | Minor Version |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Add optional field | No change     | Increment     |
| Add required field | Increment     | Reset         |
| Change field type  | Increment     | Reset         |

Some valid examples of versions:
- `v1`
- `v2`
- `v3`

Some invalid examples of versions:
- `v1.0`
- `ver1`
- `current`
- `v1beta`

## Resources

Resources are represented by a path that follows a base URL. You can consider
the resource path as the canonical path for a resource, despite the base URL.

These are the full URLs from the base URL section:

- `https://api.company.com/data/v1/widgets/a1b2c3`
- `https://product.company.com/api/v1/widgets/a1b2c3`
- `https://company.com/api/v1/widgets/a1b2c3`

Note that if you strip the base URL from the front, they are now all the same:

- `/widgets/a1b2c3`
- `/widgets/a1b2c3`
- `/widgets/a1b2c3`

What follows are some more specific guidelines around resource paths.

### General

Here are some basics for RESTful URLs:

- A URL identifies a resource.
- URLs must use plural nouns, not verbs.
- Do not use "formats" in the URL. Some APIs place a type, like `.json`, at
the end of the URL.

### Collections, Resources, and Nesting

Given a resource path like...

`/widgets/a1b2c3/sprockets`

...you can note several things:

- `widgets` and `sprockets` are collections. They are plural nouns.
Collections hold resources and relate to the "type" of something.
- Some specific resources, like this one (`a1b2c3`) may themselves hold
collections (in this case, `sprockets`). Only in extrodinary situations should
you consider nesting any further, and you should not specify a resource after
the secondary collection (like `/widgets/a1b2c3/sprockets/d4f5g6`).
- If you're using a nested resource, like `/widget/a1b2c3/sprockets`, note that
this is a strong implication that `sprockets` **must** be created as a child of
a single `widget` (`a1b2c3`). What this then implicates is that you may not,
in general, create a `sprocket` at the root `sprocket` endpoint. The root `sprocket`
endpoint may list all of the current context's `sprocket`s, or similar, but in
general should not accept creation requests. In concrete examples:
  - `POST /sprockets` is invalid.
  - `POST /widgets/a1b2c3/sprockets` will create a `sprocket` that may be
  returned as a property within `/widgets/a1b2c3`.
  - `GET /widgets/a1b2c3/sprockets` will return all the `sprocket`s that are
  in the collection for the `a1b2c3` widget.
  - `GET /sprockets/d4f5g6` will return a specific `sprocket`.
  - `GET /sprockets` may return all `sprocket`s, regardless of `widget`
  collection.

## Requests

There are few stipulations involved with an API request. APIs should aim to be
permissive and not rigid wherever that does not introduce ambiguity.

### Methods

Methods, or HTTP verbs, should be used in compliance with their definitions
under the HTTP/1.1 [Method Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)
standard.

The following mapping guides the verbs to some equivalent wording.

| Method  | Synonym  | Description                                                                          |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET     | Fetch    | Return the specified resource or list of resources                                   |
| POST    | Create   | Create a new resource in the specified collection                                    |
| PATCH   | Update   | Update the specified existing resource                                               |
| PUT     | Replace  | Replace the specified resource                                                       |
| DELETE  | Remove   | Delete the specified resource                                                        |
| OPTIONS | Define   | View the schema and available actions for the resource or collection                 |
| HEAD    | Describe | Return all of the information about a resource without returning the response itself |

The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type
being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs
can map to different actions depending on context.

| Method          | Endpoint          | Description         |
| --------------- | ---------------   | ------------------- |
| `POST`          | `/widgets`        | Create a widget     |
| `GET`           | `/widgets`        | List widgets        |
| `POST`          | `/widgets/a1b2c3` | Invalid             |
| `GET`           | `/widgets/a1b2c3` | Get a single widget |

### Headers

The most basic header that API services must support, and that clients
should provide, is the `Content-Type` header. In general, the client will
supply this header with the value `application/json` to specify that the
request body is JSON. However, API services must not require this header and
must default to this (`application/json`) media type if unspecified.

This creates an implication that the API service must be particularly resilient
and stringent in its request parsing in order to prevent security issues.

Similarly, if an `Accepts` header is unspecified, the service may assume that
the media type should be `application/json`, though it must be rigorous in
specifying this in the response's `Content-Type` header.

These specifications can be considered a direct application of [Postel's
Robustness Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle).

### Querying

Querying, to specify certain output in the response, is generally very open.
No API service should reject or strip any particular query parameters, and
modifying the query (or "search") portion of the URL must be an exclusively
additive process. By extension, even queries that may seem nonsensical (for
example, specifying a limit as if paginating, on a request for a single
resource) must not be rejected as invalid input.

There are some query parameters that must be supported by any API service:

| Parameter | Description                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `limit`   | Maximum number of items to return, if listing resources. |
| `offset`  | Where in the result set to begin listing resources.      |

## Responses

Most APIs should return JSON responses in a particular format. We'll begin
with an example response.

```json
{
    "_meta": {
        "$schema": "https://api.leadpages.io/data/v1/widgets/schema",
        "_limit": 20,
        "_total": 30,
        "_count": 10,
        "_offset": 20
    },
    "_items": [
        {
            "_meta" :{
                "_id": "5cd9b168-ed04-11e4-a659-fd8bf206b734",
                "_uri": "https://api.leadpages.io/data/v1/widgets/5cd9b168-ed04-11e4-a659-fd8bf206b734",
                "_created": "2015-04-24T18:35:10.656940+00:00",
                "_updated": "2015-04-24T18:35:10.656976+00:00",
            },
            "color": "fuschia",
            "make": "Spacely"
        }
    ]
}
```

Some things to notice about this response format:

- Several of the fields begin with an `_`. All underscore-prefixed keys are
reserved and may not be used for data properties. Additionally, they are
read-only.
- This is a response from listing widgets. We have two clear ways of inferring
this:
    - The `_meta` section includes pagination information.
    - There is an `_items` key at the root of the response object, that is a
    list of objects.
- For the widget in the list, there are additional `_meta` properties for that
specific resource, as well as some actual data properties
(`color` and `make`).

There are also two very general patterns to notice:

- No values are used as keys.
- The response is an object despite the fact that it is returning a listing.
The listing is nested within the containing object.

### IDs

Every resource should have a unique ID associated with it, and in general
these should be version 4 UUIDs as specified in [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
A resource's ID must be returned in the `_id` property in the `_meta` section
of the response.

### Timestamps

Timestamps included in responses must always be in the timezone-aware
[ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/) format.

There are two timestamps that exemplify this format that must be returned
with every resource, as seen above. They represent the creation and update
times for this resoure, where the creation time (`_created`) is set only once
when the resource is created, and the update time (`_updated`) reflects the
most recent time the resource was updated.

### URIs

URIs present in the response should be absolute, including host and protocol
(i.e., HTTPS). This prevents ambiguity if, in some future state, there is a
need to reference schema, resources, etc. across domains, and also assists in
making the [HTTPS-only](#ssltls) requirement concrete.

Additionally, resources must be returned with a `_uri` property that
always returns the canonical version of the resource. Note that there may be
special cases regarding this URI as specified in the [versioning](#versioning)
section.

### Pagination

The pagination parameters are as follows:

| Key       | Description                                                         |
| --------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------    |
| `_limit`  | Max number of items that may be returned in this listing.           |
| `_total`  | Total number of items that matched the listing or query.            |
| `_count`  | Actual number of items in the listing response.                     |
| `_offset` | The starting point in the result set that this response represents. |

### Error Handling

Error responses should include a message for the developer, an optional
internal (diagnostic) error code, and documentation links (if applicable)
where developers can find more info. For example:

```json
{
    "error_code": 400,
    "error_ref" : "a1b2c3",
    "message": "The attribute `foo` is required.",
    "ref": [
        "http://docs.leadpages.io/errors/400",
        "http://docs.leadpages.io/errors/a1b2c3",
        "http://docs.leadpages.io"
    ]
}
```

Tend towards the most common response codes when indicating success, failure,
or status. All of the reason phrases should be as presented in [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
Some of the most common codes and a possible reason include:

- `200 OK` as a general success status
- `201 Created` when a new resource is created
- `204 No Content` when a resource is deleted
- `400 Bad Request` when a required value is missing
- `403 Forbidden` when not logged in
- `404 Not Found` when a resource is not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` when a server failure occurs
- `503 Service Unavailable` when the service is temporarily overloaded

### CORS

Services are responsible for providing a CORS implementation that is complete
and will allow natural communication with the API in a browser-based context.
This means that any request must also return a proper `OPTIONS` response for
that resource that will allow the request.

## Notes

Some other notes and considerations:

### XML

JSON is the only required response type at this time, and in general, XML
as a response should be considered only in exceptional cases. Other response
formats, particularly those that may be exposed as a service-to-service
interface, are not covered in the scope of this HTTP-centric document.

### JSONP

JSONP is not supported. Use CORS instead. JSONP does not support methods other
than `GET`, and is generally regarded by the community as being replaced by
CORS.

## Contributing

Contributing follows a fork, pull request & issue format. All ideas,
improvements, critiques, and fixes are welcome. All contributers, including
maintainers, must open pull requests, other than exceptional cases or basic
repository chores.

- If you have something that you feel is best represented **concretely**, just
fork the repository and **create a pull request** with your changes.
- If you have something that you feel is an **idea**, **brainstorm topic**, or
is otherwise **still cookin'**, feel free to **open an issue** and use the
"idea" tag.
